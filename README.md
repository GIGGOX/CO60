# CO60 PCB

The CO60 was developed out of the desire to make available a 60% PCB
that appeals to many people and is readily available. CO60 is a
portmanteau of Community and 60% keyboard.

## Overview

The CO60 aims to meet the following design goals:

* Switches oriented such that the LEDs are South-facing, for
  compatibility with Cherry profile keycaps.

* USB Type-C support in both A to C and C to C configurations.

* QMK Support.

* A variety of split spacebar configurations, including split 6.25U
  space and split 7U space.

* ESD protection circuitry, including data line protection and a
  polyfuse on the VCC line.

* Support for per-switch LED backlighting.
