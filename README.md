# CO60 PCB

The CO60 was developed out of the desire to make available a 60% PCB
that appeals to many people and is readily available. CO60 is a
portmanteau of Community and 60% keyboard.

## Overview

The CO60 aims to meet the following design goals:

* Switches oriented such that the LEDs are South-facing, for
  compatibility with Cherry profile keycaps.

* USB Type-C support in both A to C and C to C configurations.

* QMK Support.

* A variety of split spacebar configurations, including split 6.25U
  space and split 7U space.

* ESD protection circuitry, including data line protection and a
  polyfuse on the VCC line.

* Support for per-switch LED backlighting.

## Supported Layouts

The CO60 supports the [the following layouts](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/b488496b3a71c8192113c07e298be340).

## Motivation

There are a number of 60% keyboard PCBs available today, so it is
important to be clear about the reasons for developing another. This
PCB is the only one, to the best of the designer's knowledge, to
satisfy ALL of the following criteria:

* Support for MX switches oriented such that the LEDs are South
  facing, for compatibility with Cherry profile keycaps.

* Support for split spacebars, in both 6.25U and 7U configurations.

* USB Type-C connection that supports both A to C and C to C
  configurations.
