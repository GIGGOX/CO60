# CO60 PCB

The CO60 was developed out of the desire to make available a 60% PCB
that appeals to many people and is readily available. CO60 is a
portmanteau of Community and 60% keyboard.

## Overview

The CO60 aims to meet the following design goals:

* Switches oriented such that the LEDs are South-facing, for
  compatibility with Cherry profile keycaps.

* USB Type-C support in both A to C and C to C configurations.

* QMK support.

* A variety of split spacebar configurations, including split 6.25U
  space and split 7U space.

* ESD protection circuitry, including data line protection and a
  polyfuse on the VCC line.

* Support for per-switch LED backlighting.

* Fits in standard 60% keyboard cases.

## Supported Layouts

The CO60 supports the [the following layouts](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/b488496b3a71c8192113c07e298be340).

## Motivation

There are a number of 60% keyboard PCBs available today, so it is important to
be clear about the reasons for developing another. This PCB is the only 60%
keyboard PCB, to the best of the designer's knowledge, to satisfy ALL of the
following criteria:

* Support for MX switches oriented such that the LEDs are South
  facing, for compatibility with Cherry profile keycaps.

* Support for split spacebars, in both 6.25U and 7U configurations.

* USB Type-C connection that supports both A to C and C to C
  configurations.

* Open source hardware. This allows anybody to do a production run of the board
  at any point, and doesn't lock the design in with a particular vendor.

* QMK support.
