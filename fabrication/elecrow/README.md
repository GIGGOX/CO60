This directory contains the spreadsheet that was sent to Elecrow in
order to obtain a quotation and then to provide the information they
required for manufacturing and assembly of the CO60.

Provided that Elecrow has not changed their templates, a person
interested in having Elecrow do a production run of the board,
including assembly, should be able to submit the spreadsheet in this
directory, along with the Gerbers, and have the boards produced.
